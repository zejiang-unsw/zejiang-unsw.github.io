This is Ze Jiang's personal homepage.

## A short introduction
I am an engineer, hydro-climatologist and researcher. My research focuses on drought detection and attribution, as well as prediction using GCM simulations. I mainly use statistical tools to carry out my research works. I am also an R enthusiast. I am currently working at [WRC@UNSW](https://www.wrc.unsw.edu.au/).

<b>RESEARCH INTEREST:</b>
* Wavelet based time series decomposition and transformation
* Hydro-climatological modelling and forecasting
* Climate change impact on the water cycle (e.g. floods and droughts)
